    <title>Second-Order Linear ODEs</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Recall that a second-order ODE is an ODE whose highest derivative is the second derivative.
        In this section, we'll look at how to solve second-order ODEs of a special type.
        Our method of solution here will be generalized to many, many other ODEs.

        A first-order ODE is linear if it can be written in the form <m>y^\prime+P(x)y = Q(x)</m> (see <xref ref="definition-first-order-linear-odes" text="type-global" />).
        We have a similar definition for second-order ODEs.

          Consider the following ODEs:

        Newton's Second Law is a great source of linear second-order ODEs, as <xref ref="example-a-second-order-model" text="type-global" /> shows.

          <p>
            Consider an object attached to a spring.
            The force exerted by the spring on the object is directly proportional to the displacement of the object from the spring's equilibrium, or at rest, position.

        <title>A second-order model</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            An object of mass <quantity><mag>4</mag><unit base="gram" prefix="kilo"/></quantity> is attached to a horizontal, frictionless spring.
            Let <m>x=0</m> denote the equilibrium position of the spring and let <m>x(t)</m> denote the displacement of the mass from the spring's equilibrium position.
            The only force acting on the mass is the force of the spring itself.
            Find a mathematical model for <m>x(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Let <m>F_{S}</m> denote the force of the spring on the mass.
            Then by <xref ref="theorem-hooke-s-law" text="type-global" /> we must have <m>F_{S} = -kx</m> for some <m>k&gt;0</m>.
            Now, by Newton's Second Law we must also have <m>F_{S} = 4x''</m>.
            Hence
            <me>4x'' = -kx\quad\text{or}\quad4x''+kx = 0.</me>
            So the motion of the mass is modeled by a linear, second-order homogeneous ODE.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <aside>
        <p>
          The reason we take <m>F_{S} = -kx</m> in Hooke's Law is because we want to emphasize that the spring force is a <em>restoring force</em>, since it acts against the displacement of the mass.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        The general trend that we will see for mathematical models using linear ODEs is that they will be homogeneous if we assume that there is no external force, and nonhomogeneous if we assume there is an external force.

        The reason we restrict ourselves to linear ODEs is because their solutions behave very nicely.
        In particular, we have the <xref ref="theorem-the-superposition-principle" text="type-global" />, which is an important principle for homogeneous ODEs.

      <p>
        <xref ref="theorem-the-superposition-principle" text="type-global" /> is important because it tells us how to construct new solutions of homogeneous ODEs out of known solutions.
        The next example demonstrates this.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="example-solving-a-second-order-ivp">
        <title>Solving a second-order IVP</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Using the fact that <m>y_{1} = \cosh\frac{x}{2}</m> and <m>y_{2} = \sinh\frac{x}{2}</m> are both solutions of <m>4y''-y = 0</m>, solve the IVP given by
            <me>4y''-y=0\quad\text{and}\quad y(0)=3,y^\prime(0)=1.</me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Note that we have <em>two</em> initial conditions.
            In general, we'll need as many initial conditions as the order of the ODE.
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve the IVP, we'll use the superposition principle to give us as much leeway as possible in constructing a solution of out <m>y_{1}</m> and <m>y_{2}</m>.
            So we'll guess the solution takes the form <m>y = c_{1}\cosh\frac{x}{2} + c_{2}\sinh\frac{x}{2}</m>.
            By the superposition principle we're guaranteed that this is a solution of the ODE <m>4y''-y=0</m>, so we just need to pick the constants <m>c_{1},c_{2}</m> in order to satisfy the initial conditions.
            Let's start with the first initial condition, <m>y(0) = 3</m>.
            This gives us the equation
            <me>3 = c_{1}\cosh0+c_{2}\sinh0 = 3.</me>
            So <m>c_{1} = 3</m>.
            Similarly, <m>y^\prime(0) = 1</m> gives us
            <me>1 = \frac{3}{2}\sinh0+\frac{c_{2}}{2}\cosh0 = \frac{c_{2}}{2}.</me>
            Hence <m>c_{2} = 2</m>, and the solution of the IVP is
            <me>y = 3\cosh\frac{x}{2} + 2\sinh\frac{x}{2}.</me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        The reason we were able to solve the IVP in <xref ref="example-solving-a-second-order-ivp" text="type-global" /> was because the individual solutions <m>\cosh\frac{x}{2}</m> and <m>\sinh\frac{x}{2}</m> gave us enough to build the particular solution of the IVP.
        It turns out that <em>every</em> solution of <m>4y''-y=0</m> can be written as a linear combination of these two functions, so knowing these two functions is enough to solve every IVP involving this ODE.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, our goal will be to describe a "basis" of solutions for a given homogeneous ODE, a finite set of solutions that can be used to describe all possible solutions.
        This can be done if the functions in the basis aren't too "similar", in the following sense.

            Two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are said to be <term>linearly independent</term> on an interval <m>I</m> if the linear combination <m>c_{1}f + c_{2}g</m> is equal to <m>0</m> if and only if <m>c_{1} = c_{2} = 0</m>.

        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        The main idea behind <xref ref="definition-linear-independence-of-functions" text="type-global" /> is that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are linearly independent if they are not like terms (i.e. they don't cancel each other out).
        Note that <m>f,g</m> are linearly dependent if and only if <m>f = \alpha g</m> for some <m>\alpha\neq 0</m>.
        Equivalently, they are linearly dependent if and only if <m>\frac{f}{g} = \alpha</m> for some <m>\alpha\neq0</m>.

          <p>
            Since <m>\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \tan x</m> is <em>not</em> constant, this means that <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> must be linearly independent.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        Although it wasn't too hard to see that the functions in <xref ref="example-linear-independence-of-sine-and-cosine" text="type-global" /> were linearly independent, in other cases it can be much trickier (especially when we move to higher order ODEs).
        For example, suppose we set <m>f(t) = -5(t-15)^{2} + 450</m> and <m>g(t) = 12t(30-t)</m>.
        Then it's not obvious at all that these two functions are linearly dependent!
        In fact,
        <me>\frac{2}{5}f(t) - \frac{1}{6}g(t) = 0.</me>
        So generally when we try to determine if two functions are linearly independent, we'll make use of the <term>Wronskian</term>.

        Once we have a basis for a second-order linear homogeneous ODE, we can solve any IVP that we wish involving that ODE.

            We need to start by showing that <m>\{x_{1},x_{2}\}</m> is a basis for the ODE.
            First, we compute <m>W(x_{1},x_{2})</m>:
            <me>W(x_{1},x_{2}) = (t\cos\ln t)(\sin\ln t + \cos\ln t) - (t\sin\ln t)(\cos\ln t - \sin\ln t) = t(\cos^{2}\ln t + \sin^{2}\ln t) = t.</me>
            So <m>W(x_{1},x_{2}) = t</m>, which is clearly nonzero on the interval <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
            Hence <m>x_{1}</m> and <m>x_{2}</m> are linearly independent, and therefore <m>\{x_{1},x_{2}\}</m> is a basis for the ODE.

          <p>
            To actually find the solution (call it <m>x</m>), we'll set <m>x = c_{1}x_{1} + c_{2}x_{2}</m> and use the initial conditions to find <m>c_{1}</m> and <m>c_{2}</m>.
            Doing so gives <m>c_{1} = 1</m> and <m>c_{2} = -2</m>, and so the solution of the IVP is

        So we need to set <m>e^{rx}(r^{2} - r - 6)</m> equal to <m>0</m> and solve for <m>r</m>, which gives
        <me>r = -2, 3.</me>
        Therefore two solutions of <m>y'' - y^\prime - 6y = 0</m> are given by <me>y_{1} = e^{-2x}</me> and <m>y_{2} = e^{3x}</m>.
        Since <m>W(y_{1},y_{2})\neq0</m>, this means that <m>c_{1}e^{-2x} + c_{2}e^{3x}</m> is actually the general solution of the ODE.

      The process in <xref ref="example-solving-a-homogeneous-ode" text="type-global" /> will work for <em>every</em> second-order homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients.
      So solving such an ODE is even easier than integrating: all we need to do is to find the roots of a particular polynomial.

      <statement>
        <p>
          An object of mass <quantity><mag>4</mag><unit base="gram" prefix="kilo"/></quantity> is attached to a horizontal, frictionless spring.
          Suppose the spring constant is given by <m>k=16</m>.
          The mass is held <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit base="meter"/></quantity> to the right of the spring's equilibrium position, and is then released at time <m>t=0</m> where <m>t</m> is in seconds.
          Find the displacement <m>x(t)</m> of the mass.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We know from <xref ref="example-a-second-order-model" text="type-global" /> that the second-order ODE given by
          <me>4x'' + kx = 0\quad\text{or}\quad x'' + 4x = 0</me>
          provides a model for <m>x(t)</m>, but now we are in a position to solve it.
          The characteristic equation of this ODE is <m>r^{2} + 4 = 0</m>, which has roots <m>r=\pm2i</m>.
          The imaginary roots <em>are not a problem</em>, and in fact provide significant information about the motion of the mass, as we'll soon see.
          The general solution of the ODE is
          <me>x = c_{1}e^{-2it} + c_{2}e^{2it}.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial conditions are <m>x(0) = 3</m> and <m>x^\prime(0) = 0</m>, which give the equations
          <md>
            <mrow>3 &amp; = c_{1} + c_{2} </mrow>
            <mrow>0 &amp; = -2ic_{1} + 2ic_{2} </mrow>
          </md>
          The second equation implies that <m>c_{1} = c_{2}</m>, and applying this to the first equation now gives <m>c_{1} = c_{2} = \frac{3}{2}</m>.
          Hence the displacement of the mass is given by
          <me>x = \frac{3}{2}e^{-2it} + \frac{3}{2}e^{2it}.</me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      The appearance of the "imaginary" solution in <xref ref="example-spring-mass-system-revisited" text="type-global" /> may seem strange, but they're actually quite natural.
      In fact, we can use <term>Euler's formula</term> to write the solution in terms of a more familiar function.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="theorem-euler-s-formula">
      <title>Euler's Formula</title>
      <idx>Euler's Formula</idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all <m>x</m>, the following equations hold:
          <md>
            <mrow>e^{ix} &amp; = \cos x + i\sin x </mrow>
            <mrow>\cos x &amp; = \frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2} </mrow>
            <mrow>\sin x &amp; = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      So using Euler's Formula on the solution from <xref ref="example-spring-mass-system-revisited" text="type-global" /> gives
      <md>
        <mrow>x &amp; = \frac{3}{2}e^{-2it} + \frac{3}{2} e^{2it} </mrow>
        <mrow> &amp; = 3\frac{e^{-2it} + e^{2it}}{2} </mrow>
        <mrow> &amp; = 3\cos2t. </mrow>
      </md>
      So the imaginary roots <m>\pm2i</m> from <xref ref="example-spring-mass-system-revisited" text="type-global" /> actually relate to the <em>frequency</em> of the spring-mass system in that problem.
      This is a trend we will see often in this course: imaginary numbers corresponding to oscillating quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we'll take a look at how to solve second-order homogeneous ODEs whose characteristic equations have repeated roots.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-repeated-roots-in-the-characteristic-equation">
      <title>Repeated roots in the characteristic equation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the general solution of <m>y'' + 2y^\prime + y = 0</m> where <m>y = y(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We begin by solving the characteristic equation, which for this ODE is
          <me>r^{2} + 2r + 1 = 0.</me>
          The only solution of this equation is <m>r=-1</m>, which is a repeated root.
          We can still get one solution of the ODE using this root, namely <m>y_{1} = e^{-x}</m>, but we need two linearly independent solutions in order to find the general solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the other solution, we'll make another guess: whatever it happens to be, it should look quite a bit like the first solution <m>e^{-x}</m>, since it still needs to cancel out with its derivatives the same way that <m>e^{-x}</m> does.
          The easiest way to get a function that looks like <m>e^{-x}</m> but is still linearly independent from <m>e^{-x}</m> is to just multiply by <m>x</m>.
          In other words, we'll guess (and check!) that <m>y_{2} = xe^{-x}</m> is another solution of <m>y''+2y^\prime+y = 0</m>.
          If we plug <m>y_{2}</m> into the ODE, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>y''_{2} + 2y'_{2} + y_{2} &amp; = \underbrace{-2e^{-x} + xe^{-x}}_{y''_{2}} + \underbrace{2e^{-x} - 2xe^{-x}}_{y'_{2}} + \underbrace{xe^{-x}}_{y_{2}} </mrow>
            <mrow> &amp; = 0, </mrow>
          </md>
          which shows that <m>y_{2}</m> is indeed a solution of the ODE.
          Since it's also linearly independent (which we can check via the Wronskian), this means that the general solution of <m>y''+2y^\prime+y=0</m> is
          <me>y = c_{1}y_{1} + c_{2}y_{2} = c_{1}e^{-x} + c_{2}xe^{-x}. </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      The method used in <xref ref="example-repeated-roots-in-the-characteristic-equation" text="type-global" /> also works for other homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients whose characteristic equations have repeated roots.
      Hence the roots of the characteristic equation <em>completely</em> determine the general solutions of such ODEs.
      We summarize this in the following table.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tabular top="major" bottom="major">
        <row bottom="major">
          <cell>Roots</cell>

        </row>
      </tabular>
    </table>
    <p>
      Remember that it's not a problem if the characteristic equation has imaginary roots, and in fact we must account for these in order to completely describe the corresponding physical system.
      If we have imaginary roots, then we can simply use Euler's Formula to rewrite the solutions in terms of sine and cosine.

      <p>
        If we let <m>x(t)</m> denote the displacement of the mass from the spring's equilibrium position and let <m>F_{S} = -kx</m> denote the force of the spring on the mass (see <xref ref="theorem-hooke-s-law" text="Hooke's Law" />, and assume that no other force is acting on the mass, then we know from <xref ref="example-a-second-order-model" text="type-global" /> that <m>x(t)</m> satisfies the second-order ODE given by
        <me>mx'' + kx = 0.</me>
        If we set <m>\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</m>, we can rewrite this to get
        <me>x'' + \omega_{0}^{2}x = 0.</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing we can notice right away about solutions of <m>x''+\omega_{0}^{2}x = 0</m> is that they should all be periodic (see <xref ref="definition-fourier-periodic-functions" text="type-global" />), which, of course, makes sense!.
        To see why, note that the roots of the characteristic equation are <m>\pm i\omega_{0}</m>, which means that the solutions may be written in the form
        <me>x = c_{1}e^{-i\omega_{0}t} + c_{2}e^{i\omega_{0}t},</me>
        which we can rewrite as
        <me>x = A\cos\omega_{0}t + B\sin\omega_{0}t</me>
        using Euler's Formula.
        Hence every solution of <m>x''+\omega_{0}^{2}x = 0</m> is a sinusoidal wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can go even further by making use of some clever algebra and the appropriate trigonometric formulas if we assume that <m>x\neq0</m> (i.e. <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not <em>both</em> <m>0</m>):
        <md>
          <mrow>x &amp; = A\cos\omega_{0}t + B\sin\omega_{0}t </mrow>
          <mrow> &amp; = \sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}}\cos\omega_{0}t + \frac{B}{\sqrt{A^{2} + B^{2}}}\sin\omega_{0}t\right) </mrow>
        </md>
        Now set <m>C = \sqrt{A^{2} + B^{2}}</m> and define <m>\varphi</m> implicitly by <m>\cos\varphi = \frac{A}{C}</m> and <m>\sin\varphi = \frac{B}{C}</m>.
        <aside>
          <p>
            There are infinitely many choices for <m>\varphi</m> here, but we can select a unique one if we make the extra restriction that <m>\varphi\in[0,2\pi)</m>.
          </p>
        </aside>
        Then we get
        <me>x = C(\cos\varphi\cos\omega_{0}t + \sin\varphi\sin\omega_{0}t) = C\cos(\omega_{0}t - \varphi).</me>
        <m>C</m> is the <term>amplitude</term> of the wave <m>x</m>, <m>\omega_{0}</m> is the <term>circular frequency</term>, <m>T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_{0}}</m> is the <term>period</term> of motion and <m>\varphi</m> is the <term>phase</term>.

        <title>Another spring-mass system</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            An object with a mass of <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="gram" prefix="kilo"/></quantity> is fixed to a spring and a force of <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="newton"/></quantity> holds the mass <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="meter"/></quantity> to the left of the spring's equilibrium position.
            If the object is released, how long will it take for the mass to return to its original position?
            And what is the position <m>x(t)</m> of the mass?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Let <m>x(t)</m> denote the position of the mass <m>t</m> seconds after being released, so that <m>x(0) = -5</m> and <m>x^\prime(0) = 0</m>.
            We could find the time it takes for the mass to return to its starting position by first finding <m>x(t)</m>, but a quicker way is to just find the period <m>T</m> of <m>x</m>.
            To do this, we must find the circular frequency <m>\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</m>.
            Thankfully, half of the work is done for us (we know <m>m=5</m>), so we only need the value of <m>k</m> which itself comes from Hooke's Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Call the spring force <m>F_{S}</m> and recall that <m>F_{S} = -kx</m>.
            We know that it takes a force of <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="newton"/></quantity> to hold the mass still at <m>x=-5</m>.
            The spring force must <em>precisely</em> counterbalance this force in order for the mass to remain still as it's held, which means that <m>F_{S} = 10</m> since <m>F_{S}</m> pulls the mass to the right.
            Therefore <m>-k(-5) = 10</m> and so <m>k=2</m>, which gives <m>\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}</m>.
            This means that the period of motion is
            <me>T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_{0}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}.</me>
          </p>
          <p>
            To find <m>x(t)</m>, we'll use the fact that it can be written as <m>x = C\cos(\omega_{0}t-\varphi)</m>.
            Since <m>C = 5</m> (because the mass can never go more than five meters from the equilibrium position) and we already know that <m>\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}</m>, we just need to find <m>\varphi</m>.
            We can just make use of the initial condition <m>x(0) = -5</m> to get this:
            <me>-5 = C\cos\varphi = 5\cos\varphi</me>
            and so we can choose <m>\varphi=\pi</m>.
            Hence
            <me>x(t) = 5\cos(\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}t-\pi).</me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <aside>
        <p>
          You may be troubled by the fact that we only explicitly used the first initial condition in this example.
          However, the second condition <m>x^\prime(0) = 0</m> was actually used implicitly: it allowed us to assume that the amplitude was <m>5</m> as opposed to another number.
          If <m>x^\prime(0)\neq0</m>, finding <m>C</m> would have been a little trickier.

        <caption>A damped spring-mass system.</caption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Now in addition to the spring force <m>F_{S}</m>, we must also worry about the force <m>F_{R}</m> of the dashpot on the mass.
        <m>F_{R}</m> is always going to act against the velocity of the mass, so for simplicity we assume that <m>F_{R} = -cx^\prime</m> for some <m>c &gt; 0</m>.
        Using <m>F_{S} = -kx</m> as usual in conjunction with Newton's Second Law gives us the second-order ODE
        <me>-cx^\prime-kx = mx''\quad\text{or}\quad mx'' + cx + kx = 0.</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This ODE is homogeneous and has constant coefficients so we may solve it using the method of characteristic equations.
        The characteristic equation of this ODE is
        <men xml:id="equation-characteristic-free-damped">mr^{2} + cr + k = 0</men>
        The roots of this equation are
        <men xml:id="equation-characteristic-free-damped-roots">r_{1} = \frac{-c + \sqrt{c^{2} - 4km}}{2m}\quad\text{and}\quad r_{2} = \frac{-c - \sqrt{c^{2} - 4km}}{2m}.</men>
        The behavior of this system therefore depends on the quantity <m>c^{2} - 4km</m>, and so we have three cases to consider.
      </p>
      <ol marker="1:">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>c^{2} - 4km \gt 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, the characteristic equation <xref ref="equation-characteristic-free-damped" text="type-global" /> has two real roots, and so the solution <m>x(t)</m> has the form
            <me>x(t) = c_{1}e^{r_{1}t} + c_{2}e^{r_{2}t}.</me>
            Now, <m>r_{1}</m> and <m>r_{2}</m> are both negative since <m>c^{2} - 4km \lt c^{2}</m> (remember that we're assuming that <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> are positive!).
            This means that <m>x(t)\to0</m> as <m>t\to\infty</m>.
            There is no oscillation present in the motion of the mass in this case since the mass never passes through <m>x = 0</m>, so we call this <term>overdamped motion</term>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>c^{2} - 4km = 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, the characteristic equation <xref ref="equation-characteristic-free-damped" text="type-global" /> has a repeated (real) root, and so the solution <m>x(t)</m> takes the form
            <me>x(t) = e^{r_{1}t}(c_{1} + c_{2}t).</me>
            This mass can pass through <m>x = 0</m> only once, at <m>t = -\frac{c_{1}}{c_{2}}</m>.
            Once it does, the mass will "turn around" soon afterwards and beginning moving back to <m>0</m>, as in the first case.
            We call this type of motion <term>critically damped</term>, since it's right on the border between overdamped motion and oscillating motion.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>c^{2} - 4km \lt 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case the characteristic equation <xref ref="equation-characteristic-free-damped" text="type-global" /> has two distinct complex roots of the form <m>r = a \pm bi</m>, where
            <me>a = -\frac{c}{2m}\quad\text{and}\quad b = \frac{\sqrt{4km - c^{2}}}{2m}.</me>
            In particular, the real part <m>a</m> of these roots is always negative.
            The solution <m>x(t)</m> in this case takes the form
            <me>x(t) = e^{at}(A\cos bt + B\sin bt)</me>
            after applying Euler's formula.
            As in the previous two cases, <m>x(t)\to0</m> as <m>t\to\infty</m>.
            However, oscillation is now present in the system for all time!
            We call this motion <term>underdamped</term>, since the damping term <m>e^{at}</m> is not strong enough to cancel out the oscillation present in the system.
            Note that the real part <m>a</m> contributes to the "amplitude" <m>e^{at}</m> of the motion, while the imaginary part <m>b</m> represents the angular frequency of the motion.
            The ordinary frequency of the motion is given by <m>\frac{b}{2\pi}</m>.

        <title>A Spring-Dashpot System</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose that an object of mass <m>m = 25</m> is attached to both a spring and a dashpot.
            The mass is held <m>1</m> meter to the left of the spring's equilibrium position <m>x = 0</m>.
            The force of the spring on the mass is <m>F_{S} = -226x</m> and the force of the dashpot on the mass is <m>F_{R} = -10x^\prime</m>, where <m>x</m> is the displacement of the mass.
            At time <m>t = 0</m>, the mass is released.
            Find <m>x(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The ODE that models the motion of this mass is
            <me>25x'' + 10x^\prime + 226x = 0,</me>
            and the roots of the corresponding characteristic equation are
            <me>r_{1} = -\frac{1}{5} \pm \frac{1}{5}\sqrt{-225} = -\frac{1}{5}\pm3i.</me>
            We can already see that the motion must be underdamped since we have complex roots, and the position <m>x(t)</m> itself is given by
            <me>x(t) = e^{-\frac{t}{5}}(A\cos3t + B\sin3t).</me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we can use the initial conditions <m>x(0) = -1</m> and <m>x^\prime(0) = 0</m> to find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
            Doing so, we quickly get <m>A = -1</m> and <m>B = -\frac{1}{15}</m>.
            Hence
            <me>x(t) = -e^{-\frac{t}{5}}\left(\cos3t + \frac{1}{15}\sin3t\right).</me>

        As mentioned previously, the exponential term in <m>x(t)</m> from <xref ref="example-a-spring-dashpot-system" text="type-global" /> serves to dampen the motion of the spring.

      <p>
        <xref ref="theorem-solution-of-non-homogeneous-equations" text="type-global" /> shows that to solve <xref ref="equation-non-homogeneous" text="type-global" />, we only need to solve the associated homogeneous equation (which we're quite used to by now!) and find a <em>single</em> solution of <xref ref="equation-non-homogeneous" text="type-global" />.
        The method we will use is the <term>method of undetermined coefficients</term>, which we'll demonstrate by example.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="example-using-the-method-of-undetermined-coefficients">
        <title>Using the Method of Undetermined Coefficients</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find the general solution of the ODE given by
            <me>y'' - y^\prime - 2y = 3x + 4.</me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To find the general solution we need to do two things: find the complementary solution <m>y_{c}</m> of the associated homogeneous equation and find a single particular solution <m>y_{p}</m> of the given ODE.
            We already know how to find <m>y_{c},</m><aside><p>The characteristic equation of the ODE is <m>(r + 1)(r - 2)</m>.</p></aside> which is just
            <me>y_{c} = c_{1}e^{x} + c_{2}e^{-2x}.</me>
            Once we can find a single particular solution <m>y_{p}</m> we'll be finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we stare that the ODE, then we see that <m>y</m> and its derivatives must cancel each other and leave a polynomial.
            So it's reasonable to guess that a polynomial might be a solution of the ODE, or equivalently, <m>y_{p}</m> <em>should be a polynomial</em>.
            Since the degree<aside><p>Recall that the degree of a polynomial is just the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.</p></aside> of the right hand side is <m>1</m>, then <m>y_{p}</m> should probably be degree <m>1</m> as well.
            This means that <m>y_{p} = A_{1}x + A_{2}</m> for some constants <m>A_{1},A_{2}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To find these constants (<term>undetermined coefficients</term>), we plug our guess into the ODE to get
            <me>0 - A_{1} - 2A_{1}x - 2A_{2} = 3x + 4.</me>
            The only way for this equation to be true is for
            <md>
              <mrow> -A_{1} - 2A_{2} &amp; = 4 </mrow>
              <mrow> -2A_{1} &amp; = 3</mrow>
            </md>
            So <m>A_{1} = -\frac{3}{2}, A_{2} = \frac{5}{4}</m> and <m>y_{p} = -\frac{3}{2}x + \frac{5}{4}</m>.
            Hence the general solution of the ODE is
            <me>y = y_{c} + y_{p} = c_{1}e^{x} + c_{2}e^{-2x} - \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{5}{4}.</me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        Note that in <xref ref="example-using-the-method-of-undetermined-coefficients" text="type-global" />, we didn't need any initial conditions to find <m>y_{p}</m>.
        This means that if a non-homogeneous ODE like the one in <xref ref="example-using-the-method-of-undetermined-coefficients" text="type-global" /> represents some physical system, then the initial configuration of that system <em>has no effect on <m>y_{p}</m></em>.
        We will see soon that particular solutions correspond to external forces on a system, like gravity, whereas complementary solutions correspond to internal forces in a system, such as the spring force.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find the general solution of
            <me>y'' - 2y^\prime + y = x - \sin(2x).</me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The general solution will take the form <m>y = y_{c} + y_{p}</m>.
            Once again, we find <m>y_{c}</m> by solving the characteristic equation to get
            <me>y_{c} = c_{1}x + c_{2}xe^{x}.</me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we can make a guess as to what <m>y_{p}</m> should be, once again based on the right hand side of the ODE.
            If we want to differentiate <m>y_{p}</m> and obtain <m>x - \sin(2x)</m>, then <m>y_{p}</m> should include both an <m>x</m> term and a <m>\sin(2x)</m> term.
            If we make the guess that <m>y_{p} = A_{1}x + A_{2}\sin(2x)</m>, then we get
            <md>
              <mrow> A_{1}x - 2A_{1} &amp; = x </mrow>
              <mrow> -4A_{2}\cos(2x) - 3A_{2}\sin(2x) &amp; = -\sin(2x) </mrow>
            </md>
            This forces <m>A_{1} = 1</m> <em>and</em> <m>A_{1} = 0</m>, as well as <m>A_{2} = \frac{1}{3}</m> <em>and</em> <m>A_{2} = 0</m>.
            Obviously, this is a problem!
          </p>
          <p>
            What happened here is we didn't give our guess for <m>y_{p}</m> enough flexibility.
            We know we want <m>y_{p}</m> to involve <m>x</m> and <m>\sin(2x)</m>, but as soon as we plug this into the ODE and start differentiating constant terms and cosine terms will begin to appear, and <em>we need to account for these as well</em>.
            So we'll update our guess for <m>y_{p}</m>, and assume
            <me>y_{p} = A_{1}x + A_{2} + A_{3}\cos(2x) + A_{4}\sin(2x).</me>
            Plugging this into the ODE and collecting like terms gives
            <md>
              <mrow>A_{1} &amp; = 1</mrow>
              <mrow>-2A_{1} + A_{2} &amp; = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>-3A_{3} - 4A_{4} &amp; = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>4A_{3} - 3A_{4} &amp; = -1</mrow>
            </md>
            Hence
            <md>
              <mrow>A_{1} &amp; = 1 </mrow>
              <mrow>A_{2} &amp; = 2 </mrow>
              <mrow>C &amp; = -\frac{4}{25} </mrow>
              <mrow>D &amp; = \frac{3}{25} </mrow>
            </md>
            and the solution of our ODE is
            <me>c_{1}e^{x} + c_{2}xe^{x} + x + 2 - \frac{4}{25}\cos(2x) + \frac{3}{25}\sin(2x).</me>

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We can start this example the same way we've done the previous ones.
            First, we find <m>y_{c}</m> by solving <m>y''+9y=0</m>.
            So
            <me> y_{c} = c_{1}\cos(3x)+c_{2}\sin(3x).</me>
            Now we find <m>y_{p}</m>.
            Since the RHS of the ODE is <m>3\cos(3x)</m>, we'll guess that <m>y_{p} = A\cos(3x)+B\sin(3x)</m>.
            However, this will cause us problems!
            Since <m>\cos(3x),\sin(3x)</m> are both solutions of the corresponding homogeneous ODE, then plugging <m>y_{p}</m> into <m>y''+9y</m> will just give <m>0</m> again, instead of <m>3\cos(3x)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem here is that our guess for <m>y_{p}</m> overlaps with <m>y_{c}</m>.
            To fix this, we'll multiply our guess for <m>y_{p}</m> by the <em>smallest</em> power of <m>x</m> that removes the overlap.
            In this case, we'll just multiply by <m>x</m> to get
            <me>y_{p} = x[A\cos(3x)+B\sin(3x)]</me>
            Now, we'll plug our modified guess into the ODE and set it equal to <m>3\cos(3x)</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow>3\cos(3x)&amp; = y_{p}'' + 9y</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = -6A\sin(3x)+6B\cos(3x)</mrow>
            </md>
            So we need <m>-6A = 0</m> and <m>6B = 3</m>, or just <m>A = 0,B = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
            Hence
            <me>y_{p} = x\left[\frac{1}{2}\sin(3x)\right],</me>
            and the general solution is then
            <me>y = y_{c}+y_{p} = c_{1}\cos(3x)+c_{2}\sin(3x) + \frac{x}{2}\sin(3x).</me>
          </p>
          <p>
            To find the solution of the IVP, we just plug in the initial conditions.
            Since <m>y(0) = 1</m>, this gives
            <me>1 = c_{1}.</me>
            And since
            <me>y^\prime = -3c_{1}\sin(3x)+3c_{2}\cos(3x) + \frac{1}{2}\sin(3x)+\frac{3}{2}x\cos(3x),</me>
            <m>y^\prime(0)=-1</m> gives
            <me>-1 = 3c_{2}\Rightarrow c_{2} = -\frac{1}{3}.</me>
            So
            <me>y = \cos(3x)-\frac{1}{3}\sin(3x)+\frac{x}{2}\sin(3x).</me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        What we did in <xref ref="example-method-of-undetermined-coefficients-with-overlap" text="type-global" /> will work in general: if <m>y_{c}</m> and the initial guess for <m>y_{p}</m> overlap, i.e. contain linearly dependent terms, then we multiply <m>y_{p}</m> by the <em>smallest</em> power of <m>x</m> (or the appropriate independent variable) that removes the overlap.

        In this section we will develop models for certain systems under the influence of a periodic, external force.
        The presence of an external force leads to non-homogeneous models, and we will use the techniques we developed in <xref ref="section-solutions-of-nonhomogeneous-equations" text="type-global" /> to deal with these systems.

        Consider the spring-mass system set up as in <xref ref="figure-spring-mass-system" text="type-global" />.
        Then we know that the displacement <m>x(t)</m> satisfies <m>x'' + \omega_{0}^{2}x = 0</m>, where <m>\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</m>.

      <p>
        Now suppose that an external force <m>F_{E} = F_{0}\cos(\omega t)</m> also acts on the mass.

        <me>x'' + \omega_{0}^{2}x = \frac{F_{0}}{m}\cos(\omega t).</me>
        The solution of this ODE is then <m>x = x_{c} + x_{p}</m>, where

        <solution>
          <p>
            We can answer this question by determining if resonance is present in this system.
            The external frequency is <m>\omega = 2</m>, and the internal frequency is <m>\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</m>.
            Since <m>k = 8</m> and <m>m = 2</m>, we have <m>\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{2}} = 2</m>, and so the frequencies match.
            Hence the system is in resonance, and we can expect the spring to eventually break.

      <title>Damped Systems</title>
      <p>
        Now we'll take a look at forced, damped systems.
        Suppose a mass <m>m</m> is fixed to a spring with spring force <m>F_{S} = -kx</m>, and is acted upon by a dashpot with force <m>F_{R} = -cx^\prime</m>, where <m>c,k \gt 0</m> and <m>x</m> represents the displacement of the mass at time <m>t</m>.
        If the mass is still acted upon by an external force <m>F_{E} = F_{0}\cos(\omega t)</m>, then by Newton's Second Law the displacement <m>x</m> must satisfy
        <me>mx'' + cx^\prime + kx = F_{0}\cos(\omega t).</me>
        The solution is given by <m>x = x_{c} + x_{p}</m>, where <m>x_{c}</m> is found as in <xref ref="subsection-free-damped-motion" text="title" /> and goes to <m>0</m> as <m>t\to\infty</m>.
        With a little help from a computer algebra system such as Sage (see below), we see that
        <me>x_{p} = \frac{m(\omega_{0}^{2} - \omega^{2})F_{0}}{m^{2}(\omega_{0}^{2} - \omega^{2})^{2} + \omega^{2}c^{2}}\cos(\omega t) + \frac{\omega c F_{0}}{m^{2}(\omega_{0}^{2} - \omega^{2})^{2} + \omega^{2}c^{2}}\sin(\omega t),</me>
        where <m>\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</m> as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>x_{c}</m> will always approach <m>0</m> in these situations, as time goes on the position is determined increasingly by <m>x_{p}</m>.
        We call <m>x_{c}</m> the <term>transient solution</term> and <m>x_{p}</m> the <term>steady-state solution</term>.
        Note that resonance is impossible in this system since <m>x_{c}</m> and <m>x_{p}</m> can never overlap (assuming the external force is still a sinusoid).
        Therefore the smallest amount of damping prevents the mass from going out of control.
