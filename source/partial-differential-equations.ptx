  <title>Partial Differential Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Consider a rod that's recently been pulled out of the oven and is now cooling in a room. Let <m>T(t)</m> denote the temperature of the rod at time <m>t</m>, where <m>t</m> represents the amount of time since the rod was pulled out of the oven.
      Then we can model <m>T(t)</m> by using Newton's Law of Cooling, which states that
      <me>\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-A),</me>
      where <m>k</m> is a positive constant and <m>A</m> represents the ambient temperature of the room. This is an ordinary differential equation since it involves only one independent variable (<m>t</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      This works just fine as a simple model of the temperature of the rod, but in reality the situation is likely to be more complicated.
      For instance, the temperature of the rod will likely vary over the surface of the rod at any given time <m>t</m>. So it's reasonable to assume that the temperature of the rod should depend on <em>two</em> variables, say, <m>x</m> (position on the rod) and <m>t</m> (time).
      So the temperature of the rod would be more accurately described by a function <m>u(x,t)</m>.
      In fact, as we will see later, the temperature <m>u(x,t)</m> can be described by the <term>heat equation</term>.
    </p>
    <me>
      \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}
    </me>.
    <p>
      This is an example of a <term>partial differential equation</term>.

      <p>
        Given some quantity <m>u(x)</m> that depends solely on the variable <m>x</m>, <m>\frac{du}{dx} = u^{\prime}(x)</m> represents the rate of change of <m>u</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
        More generally, given some quantity <m>u(x,t)</m> that depends on <m>x,t</m>, we can attempt to find the rate of change of <m>u</m> with respect to each of the variables <m>x,t</m>.
        This idea leads to <term>partial derivatives</term>.

          <p>
            Let <m>u(x,t)</m> denote a function depending on the variables <m>x,t</m>.
            Then the partial derivative of <m>u</m> with respect to <m>x</m> is found by differentiating <m>u(x,t)</m> while treating <m>t</m> as a constant.
            The partial derivative of <m>u</m> with respect to <m>x</m> is denoted by
            <me>\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u\text{ or }\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\text{ or }u_{x}.</me>
            The partial derivative of <m>u</m> with respect to <m>t</m> is found similarly, and is likewise denoted by
            <me>\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u\text{ or }\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\text{ or }u_{t}.</me>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        From here we can define higher order partial derivatives, such as
        <me>\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}</me>
        or
        <me>u_{txx} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u\right)\right) = \frac{\partial^{3}u}{\partial x^{2}\partial t}.</me>
        The <term>order</term> of each of these partial derivatives is <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>, respectively.

            A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation involving one or more (partial) derivatives of an unknown function <m>u</m> that depends on two or more independent variables, usually thought of as time and position.
            The highest derivative appearing in a PDE is called the order of the PDE.

      </definition>
      <p>
        Just as ODEs in practice typically appear as initial value problems, PDEs can appear as <term>boundary value problems</term>.
        Boundary value problems involve conditions of the form
        <me>u(0,t) = u_{0},\quad u(L,t) = u_{1} \quad \text{ and }\quad u(x,0) = f(x).</me>
        These are examples of <term>boundary conditions</term>.
        In other words, boundary conditions can represent initial data at infinitely many points, as opposed to finitely many points like we had for our IVPs.

      <title>Linear homogeneous PDEs and the superposition principle</title>
      <p>
        We will mostly be concerned with <term>linear PDEs</term>, which are PDEs where the only thing we're allowed to do to the function <m>u</m> and its derivatives is multiply it by a constant.
        A linear PDE is <term>homogeneous</term> if every term contains the function <m>u</m> or one of its derivatives. A <term>solution</term> of a PDE is a function <m>u</m> that satisfies the PDE.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="example-solution-of-the-heat-equation">
        <title>Solution of the heat equation</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>u(x,t) = e^{-9t}\sin3x</m>.
            Show that this is a solution of the boundary value problem
            <me>u_{t} = u_{xx},\quad u(0,t) = u(\pi,t) = 0\quad\text{and}\quad u(x,0) = \sin3x.</me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To do so, we need to compute the partial derivatives of <m>u(x,t):</m>
          </p>
          <md>
            <mrow>u_{t}(x,t) \amp = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -9e^{-9t}\sin3x </mrow>
            <mrow>u_{x}(x,t) \amp = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 3e^{-9t}\cos3x </mrow>
            <mrow>u_{xx}(x,t) \amp = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}u_{x} = 9e^{-9t}\sin3x </mrow>
          </md>.
          <p>
            So we see that <m>u_{t} = u_{xx}</m>, which means that <m>u(x,t) = e^{-9t}\sin3x</m> is a solution of <m>u_{t} = u_{xx}</m>.
            Now it remains to show that <m>u(x,t)</m> satisfies the boundary conditions, which we can do without too much trouble.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        Just as with linear homogeneous ODEs, PDEs that are linear and homogeneous satisfy the <term>superposition principle</term>.
      </p>
      <principle xml:id="principle-superposition-principle">
        <idx><h>Superposition principle</h><h>partial differential equations</h></idx>
        <title>Superposition principle</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>c_{1}</m> and <m>c_{2}</m> denote arbitrary constants, and suppose that <m>u_{1}</m> and <m>u_{2}</m> are both solutions of the same linear homogeneous PDE.
            Then
            <me>u = c_{1}u_{1}+c_{2}u_{2}</me>
            is also a solution of the same PDE.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </principle>
      <p>
        The superposition principle is incredibly useful since it allows us to find general solutions of PDEs, which makes solving linear homogeneous PDEs somewhat tractable. If a PDE fails to be linear or homogeneous, the superposition principle is not guaranteed to hold.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="example-failure-of-the-superposition-principle">
        <title>Failure of the superposition principle</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the PDE given by
            <me>u_{t}+uu_{x} = 0.</me>
            This PDE fails to be linear because the second term involves multiplying <m>u</m> with its derivative <m>u_{x}</m>.
            However, it's not too hard to check that <m>u(x,t) = \frac{x}{t+1}</m> is a solution of the PDE, since if we plug this function into the PDE we get
            <md>
              <mrow>u_{t} + uu_{x} \amp = -\frac{x}{(t+1)^{2}} + \frac{x}{t+1}\frac{1}{t+1} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 0 </mrow>
            </md>.
            However, the closely related function <m>v(x,t) = 3u(x,t) = \frac{3x}{t+1}</m> is <em>not</em> a solution of the same PDE, since
            <me>v_{t}+vv_{x} = \frac{6x}{(t+1)^{2}}\neq0</me>
            So the superposition principle does not hold for this PDE.

      <title>Important PDEs</title>
      <p>
        As mentioned in the introduction, PDEs are useful for modeling quantities that depend on multiple independent variables.
        We finish this section by listing several of the simplest and most studied PDEs.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><m>u_{t} = c^{2}u_{xx}</m> where <m>c\gt0</m>. This is called the <term>heat</term> or <term>diffusion equation</term>. This equation is used for modeling the spread of a quantity, such as how temperature diffuses along a rod.</li>
        <li><m>u_{tt} = c^{2}u_{xx}</m> where <m>c\gt0</m>. This is called the <term>wave equation</term>, and is used for modeling vibrating motion, such as that along a plucked string.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In both PDEs above, the expression <m>u_{xx}</m> is an example of the <term>Laplacian</term> of <m>u</m>.
        The Laplacian of a function <m>u</m> at a point <m>(x,t)</m> is a measure of how <m>u(x,t)</m> differs from the average value of <m>u</m> at nearby <m>x</m>.
        In particular, the Laplacian is positive at <m>(x,t)</m> if <m>u(x,t)</m> tends to be less than nearby averages; the Laplacian is negative at <m>(x,t)</m> if <m>u(x,t)</m> tends to be greater than nearby averages; and the Laplacian at <m>(x,t)</m> is <m>0</m> if <m>u(x,t)</m> is in equilibrium with its nearby averages.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this viewpoint, we can assign physical reasoning to the heat and wave equations:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The heat equation states that the time rate of change of the temperature is proportional to the difference between the temperature at <m>(x,t)</m> and the average values of nearby temperatures.
              If the nearby average temperature is greater (i.e., the Laplacian is positive), then the temperature will increase.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The wave equation states that the acceleration of the wave height is proportional to the difference between the height of the wave at <m>(x,t)</m> and the average height at nearby points.
              If the nearby average height is greater (i.e., the Laplacian is positive), then the wave height will accelerate upwards.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal in the next section will be to determine how to solve PDEs such as these.

  <section xml:id="section-wave-equation-and-separation-of-variables">
    <title>The Wave Equation and Separation of Variables</title>
    <p>
      The main difficulty in solving PDEs (even linear ones) as compared with ODEs is that any solution of a PDE typically depends on more than one variable. Adding this extra degree of freedom into the problem greatly complicates matters.
      However, we can make this problem more reasonable by assuming that our solution <m>u(x,t)</m> depends on each variable <em>separately</em>.
      That is, we'll assume that the function we want to find, <m>u(x,t),</m> satisfies the constraint <m>u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)</m>.
      This technique is known as <term>separation of variables</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a one-dimensional string of length <m>L</m> that vibrates in the vertical direction.
      The vertical displacement of such a string depends on the horizontal position along the string, <m>x</m>, and the time <m>t</m>.
      So let <m>u(x,t)</m> denote the vertical displacement of the string at position <m>x</m> and at time <m>t</m>.
      If we assume that the string has constant density and that the force of gravity of the string is negligible, then <m>u(x,t)</m> satisfies the wave equation
      <men xml:id="equation-wave-pde">
        \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}} = c^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}
      </men>
      for some constant <m>c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that the string is also subject to the <term>boundary conditions</term>
    </p>
    <mdn>
      <mrow xml:id="equation-boundary-conditions"> u(0,t) = 0 \amp\text{ and } u(L,t) = 0</mrow>
    </mdn>.
    <p>
      In other words, the string is held fixed at both ends.
      We'll also suppose that we know the initial position of the string and the initial velocity of the string, represented by the <term>initial conditions</term>
    </p>
    <mdn>
      <mrow xml:id="equation-initial-condition">u(x,0) = f(x) \amp \text{ and } u_{t}(x,0) = g(x) </mrow>
    </mdn>.
    <p>
      Our goal will be to find <m>u(x,t)</m> subject to these conditions.
      To start, assume that <m>u(x,t) = X(x)T(t).</m>
      If we plug this into <xref ref="equation-wave-pde" text="type-global" />, then we get</p>
      <me>X(x)T''(t) = c^{2}X''(x)T(t).</me>
      <p>
        If we assume that <m>X(x),T(t)</m> are both nonzero, then we can rewrite this to get
        <me>\frac{T''(t)}{c^{2}T(t)} = \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}.</me>
        This may not look that helpful, but it actually places some serious restrictions on <m>X</m> and <m>T</m>.
        The left hand side of this equation only depends on <m>t</m> whereas the right hand side depends only on <m>x</m>.
        So the only way for this equation to be true for <em>all</em> <m>x,t</m> is if both sides are constant:
        <me>\frac{T''(t)}{c^{2}T(t)} = \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = k</me>
        for some <m>k</m>.
        This now gives us two separate <em>ordinary</em> differential equations for <m>T(t)</m> and <m>X(x)</m>:</p>
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="equation-separation-of-variables-1">X''(x) - kX(x) \amp = 0 </mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="equation-separation-of-variables-2">T''(t) - kc^{2}T(t) \amp = 0</mrow>
        </mdn>.
        <p>
          We can add a few more restrictions to these ODEs to help us solve them.
          Note that the boundary conditions <xref ref="equation-boundary-conditions" text="type-global" /> force either <m>X(0) = X(L) = 0</m> or <m>T(t) = 0</m> for all <m>t</m>, which leads to <m>u(x,t) = 0</m>.
          So to avoid this trivial solution, we'll set <m>X(0) = X(L) = 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll solve <xref ref="equation-separation-of-variables-1" text="type-global" /> first since we have extra information to use.
          So to start, suppose that <m>k&gt;0</m> and write <m>k = \mu^{2}</m> for some nonzero <m>\mu</m>.
          Then <xref ref="equation-separation-of-variables-1" text="type-global" /> becomes <m>X''-\mu^{2}X = 0</m> and has solution given by
          <me>X(x) = c_{1}\sinh\mu x + c_{2}\cosh \mu x.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, <m>X(0)=0</m> forces <m>c_{2} = 0</m>, so we get <m>X(x) = c_{1}\sinh\mu x</m>.
          However, since <m>X(L) = 0</m> as well, we get <m>c_{1}\sinh\mu L = 0</m>.
          But the only way to solve this is to set <m>c_{1} = 0</m> since <m>\sinh u = 0</m> only if <m>u=0</m>.
          So in other words, if we assume that <m>k = \mu^{2}\gt0</m>, then the only way to solve <xref ref="equation-separation-of-variables-1" text="type-global" /> is to set <m>X(x) = 0</m>, which also forces <m>u(x,t) = 0</m>.
          Obviously, this isn't very useful.
          Similarly, if we assume that <m>k=0</m> then we get the same problem.
          So let's assume that <m>k=-\mu^{2}\lt0</m> for some nonzero <m>\mu</m>.
          Then <xref ref="equation-separation-of-variables-1" text="type-global" /> becomes <m>X''+\mu^{2}X = 0</m>, which has solution
        </p>
        <me>
        X(x) = c_{1}\sin\mu x + c_{2}\cos \mu x.
      </me>
      <p>
        The condition <m>X(0) = 0</m> forces <m>c_{2} = 0</m>, and the second boundary condition <m>X(L) = 0</m> forces <m>c_{1}\sin \mu L = 0</m>.
        We want to avoid setting <m>c_{1}</m> equal to <m>0</m> since this would give us <m>X=0</m> again, so we'll set <m>\sin \mu L= 0</m> instead.
        <em>This</em> tells us that <m>\mu L = n\pi</m> for some integer <m>n</m>, or just <m>\mu = \frac{n\pi}{L}</m>.
        So nontrivial solutions of <xref ref="equation-separation-of-variables-1" text="type-global" /> that satisfy the boundary conditions <m>X(0)=X(L) = 0</m> can occur only if <m> k = -\mu^{2}</m> where <m>\mu = \frac{n\pi}{L}</m> and <m>n=\pm1,\pm2,\ldots</m>.
        For each choice of <m>n</m> (ignoring sign), we get the solution <m>X_{n} = \sin\frac{n\pi}{L}x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we move on to solving <xref ref="equation-separation-of-variables-2" text="type-global" />, but we still need to keep the condition <m>k=-(\frac{n\pi}{L})^{2}</m> for <m>n=\pm1,\pm2,\ldots</m>.
        If we do so, then <xref ref="equation-separation-of-variables-2" text="type-global" /> becomes <m>T''+(c\frac{n\pi}{L})^{2}T=0</m>, which has solutions given by
        <me>
        T_{n} = b_{n}\cos\lambda_{n}t+b^{*}_{n}\sin\lambda_{n}t,
      </me>
      where <m>\lambda_{n} = c\frac{n\pi}{L}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this means that every function of the form
      <me>u_{n}(x,t) = X_{n}T_{n} = \sin\frac{n\pi}{L}x\left(b_{n}\cos\lambda_{n}t+b^{*}_{n}\sin\lambda_{n}t\right)</me>
      is a solution of <xref ref="equation-wave-pde" text="type-global" /> subject to the boundary conditions <xref ref="equation-boundary-conditions" text="type-global" />.
      It also follows from the superposition principle that any (finite) linear combination of these functions will give another solution that satisfies the boundary conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this does <em>not</em> guarantee that we can solve for the initial conditions in <xref ref="equation-initial-condition" text="type-global" />.
      To give ourselves as general a solution as possible, we will guess that the solution to the wave equation is actually a linear combination of all possible <m>u_{n}</m>.
      That is, we'll say that
    </p>
    <me>u(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sin\frac{n\pi}{L}x\left(b_{n}\cos\lambda_{n}t+b^{*}_{n}\sin\lambda_{n}t\right).</me>
    <p>
      Now we'll use the initial conditions to actually determine <m>b_{n},b^{*}_{n}</m>.
      To start, note that we must have

      <em>This is a Fourier series</em>, and in particular it's the Fourier series of the odd extension of <m>f(x)</m> with period <m>2L</m>.
      <fn>See <xref ref="theorem-fourier-coefficients-of-even-and-odd-functions" text="type-global" />.</fn>

    <me>b_{n} = \frac{2}{L}\int_{0}^{L}f(x)\sin\frac{n\pi}{L}x\,dx.</me>

      <me>g(x) = u_{t}(x,0) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}^{*}\lambda_{n}\sin\frac{n\pi}{L}x.</me>
      This is the Fourier series for the odd extension of <m>g(x)</m> with period <m>2\pi</m>.

    <title>d'Alembert's Solution of the Wave Equation</title>
    <p>
      Although <xref ref="theorem-solution-of-the-wave-equation" text="type-global" /> solves the wave equation, it's a little complicated to work with.
      We'll try to express the solution in a simpler way.
      In particular, we'll start by trying to simplify the solution of the boundary value problem in <xref ref="example-a-string-with-fixed-ends" text="type-global" />.
      In that example, we saw that the solution of
      <me>u_{tt} = 16u_{xx}</me>
      with boundary conditions <m>u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0</m> and initial conditions
      <me>u(x,0) = f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x \amp 0\leq x\leq \frac{1}{2} \\ 2(1-x) \amp \frac{1}{2}\leq x\leq 1 \end{cases},\quad u_{t}(x,0) = 0</me>
      was given by
      <me>u(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}\sin(n\pi x)\cos(4n\pi t),</me>
      where <m>b_{n}</m> was the <m>n^{\th}</m> Fourier coefficient of the odd extension of <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we look at this, it looks kind of like a Fourier series except that we have a product of sine and cosine.
      We can make this look more like a Fourier series by using one of the product-to-sum formulas from trigonometry:
    </p>
    <me>\sin x\cos y = \frac{1}{2}[\sin(x+y)+\sin(x-y)].</me>
    <p>
      Using this formula, we get
      <me>\sin(n\pi x)\cos(4n\pi t) = \frac{1}{2}[\sin[n\pi(x+4t)]+\sin[n\pi(x-4t)],</me>
      which means we can write the solution <m>u(x,t)</m> as
      <me>u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}\sin[n\pi(x+4t)] + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}\sin[n\pi(x-4t)]\right].</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's how this helps us.
      Since <m>b_{n}</m> is the <m>n^{\th}</m> Fourier coefficient of the odd extension of <m>f(x)</m>, each of these sums must be a Fourier series for the odd extension of <m>f(x)</m>!
      In particular, if we denote the odd extension by <m>f^{*}(x)</m> then we can simply say that
    </p>
    <me>u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}[f^{*}(x+4t)+f^{*}(x-4t)].</me>
    <p>
      We can extend this to other boundary value problems without an initial velocity component.

        <p>
          We can do so very easily with <xref ref="theorem-d-alembert-s-solution-without-initial-velocity" text="type-global" />, since the initial velocity of the string is <m>0</m>.
          So we have
          <me>u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}[f^{*}(x-t)+f^{*}(x+t)],</me>
          where <m>f^{*}</m> is the odd extension of <m>f(x)</m>.
          However, since <m>f(x)</m> is itself an odd function, it follows that the odd extension is simply <m>\sin\pi x-\frac{1}{2}\sin2\pi x</m>.
          Therefore the solution is
        </p>
        <me>u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[\sin(\pi(x-t))-\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\pi(x-t)) + \sin(\pi(x+t)) - \frac{1}{2}\sin(2\pi(x+t))\right].</me>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      d'Alembert's solution is very useful if we want to model a vibrating string with zero initial velocity.
      But what can we do if the string has an initial velocity?
      d'Alembert's solution actually suggests a possible approach to take.
      If we look at <xref ref="theorem-d-alembert-s-solution-without-initial-velocity" text="type-global" />, it essentially states that the solution of the wave equation (assuming zero initial velocity) is the superposition of the rightward traveling wave <m>f(x-ct)</m> with the leftward traveling wave <m>f(x+ct)</m>.
      This suggests that superpositions of waves are fundamental to solutions of the wave equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll try something similar for the case <m>u_{t}(x,0) = g(x)</m>.
      We'll assume that adding in this initial velocity also adds in a new rightward traveling wave <m>G(x-ct)</m> and a new leftward traveling wave <m>H(x+ct)</m> into our solution <m>u(x,t)</m>, so that we have
    </p>
    <me>u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}[f^{*}(x-ct)+f^{*}(x+ct)] + G(x-ct) + H(x+ct).</me>
    <p>
      Now we'll try to use the initial conditions to find <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>.
      Now, since we need <m>u(x,0) = f(x)</m> this forces
    </p>
    <me>G(x) + H(x) = 0\Rightarrow H(x) = -G(x).</me>
    <p>
      Therefore our solution becomes
      <me>u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}[f^{*}(x-ct)+f^{*}(x+ct)] + G(x-ct) - G(x+ct).</me>
      If we use the second initial condition <m>u_{t}(x,0) = g(x),</m> then we get
      <me>g(x) = -cG'(x) - cG'(x) = -2cG'(x) \Rightarrow G'(x) = -\frac{1}{2c}g(x).</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can integrate both sides to find <m>G(x)</m>!
      So there exists some <m>x_{0}</m> such that
      <me>G(x) = -\frac{1}{2c}\int_{x_{0}}^{x}g(s)\,ds.</me>
      Therefore
      <md>
        <mrow>u(x,t) \amp = \frac{1}{2}[f^{*}(x-ct)+f^{*}(x+ct)] + G(x-ct) + H(x+ct) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2}[f^{*}(x-ct)+f^{*}(x+ct)] + G(x-ct) - G(x+ct) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2}[f^{*}(x-ct)+f^{*}(x+ct)] - \frac{1}{2c}\int_{x_{0}}^{x-ct}g(s)\,ds + \frac{1}{2c}\int_{x_{0}}^{x+ct}g(s)\,ds </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2}[f^{*}(x-ct)+f^{*}(x+ct)] + \frac{1}{2c}\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct}g(s)\,ds </mrow>
      </md>.
      This gives the following adjustment to d'Alembert's solution.

        If we're given an initial temperature distribution <m>f(x)</m>, then <m>u(x,t)</m> is the solution of the boundary value problem

      <p>
        We can solve this boundary value problem using separation of variables, much as we did in <xref ref="section-wave-equation-and-separation-of-variables" text="type-global" />.
        So to start, we assume that <m>u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)</m>.
        If we plug this into the heat equation <xref ref="equation-one-dimensional-heat-equation" />, then we get
      </p>
      <men xml:id="equation-odes-from-heat-equation"> \frac{T'}{c^{2}T} = \frac{X''}{X} = k.</men>
      <p>
        Now we have three separate cases to consider for <m>k</m>: <m>k\gt0, k=0</m> or <m>k\lt0</m>.
        Just as with the wave equation, the only case that doesn't lead to trivial solutions is <m>k=-\mu^{2}\lt0</m>.
        In this case <xref ref="equation-odes-from-heat-equation" text="type-global" /> leads to the two ODEs given by
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>X''+\mu^{2}X \amp = 0 </mrow>
        <mrow>T^{\prime}+c^{2}\mu^{2}T \amp = 0 </mrow>
      </md>.
      <p>
        The boundary conditions in <xref ref="heat-equation-boundary-conditions-fixed-temperature" /> force <m>X(0) = X(L) = 0</m>, and the only nontrivial solutions of <m>X''+\mu^{2}X = 0</m> occur when <m>\mu = \frac{n\pi}{L}</m>.
        So we get the solutions <m>X = X_{n} = \sin\frac{n\pi}{L}x</m>, just as with the wave equation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second ODE, we readily solve it to obtain <m>T = T_{n} = b_{n}e^{-\lambda_{n}^{2}t}</m> where <m>\lambda_{n} = c\frac{n\pi}{L}</m> as before.
        So every function
        <me>u_{n}(x,t) = X_{n}T_{n} = b_{n}\sin\frac{n\pi}{L}xe^{-\lambda_{n}^{2}t}</me>
        is a solution of <xref ref="equation-one-dimensional-heat-equation" /> that satisfies the boundary equations <xref ref="heat-equation-boundary-conditions-fixed-temperature" />.
        In order to satisfy the arbitrary initial condition <m>f(x)</m>, we take an infinite sum of the functions <m>u_{n}(x,t)</m> to get
      </p>
      <me>u(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}\sin\frac{n\pi}{L}x e^{-\lambda^{2}_{n}t}.</me>
      <p>
        Finally, if we plug in <m>t=0</m> and use the initial condition <m>u(x,0) = f(x)</m>, we get <m>f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}\sin\frac{n\pi}{L}x</m>.
        This is just the Fourier series of the odd extension of <m>f(x)</m>, which lets us find <m>b_{n}</m>.
        We summarize all of this in the following theorem.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider a thin metal bar of length <m>\pi</m> placed on the <m>x</m>-axis, with one end at <m>x=0</m> and the other at <m>x=\pi</m>.
            Assuming that <m>c=1</m> and that the initial temperature is <m>f(x) = 30\sin x</m> for <m>0\leq x\leq\pi</m>, find the temperature distribution using <xref ref="theorem-solution-of-the-heat-equation-with-fixed-temperature" text="type-global" />.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The temperature is the function <m>u(x,t)</m> given by
            <me>u(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}\sin(n x)e^{-n^{2}t},</me>
            where <m>b_{n}</m> is the <m>n^{\th}</m> coefficient of the Fourier series of the odd extension of <m>f(x)</m>.
            The odd extension of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>30\sin x</m>.
            Furthermore, the Fourier series of <m>30\sin x</m> is clearly just <m>30\sin x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So in other words,
            <me>b_{n} = \begin{cases} 30 \amp n=1 \\ 0 \amp otherwise.\end{cases}</me>
            Hence
            <me>u(x,t) = 30e^{-t}\sin x.</me>
