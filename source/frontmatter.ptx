        This document was created to serve as lecture notes for the Differential Equations course at West Virginia Wesleyan College.
        These notes are divided into two parts.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The first part, <xref ref="part-odes"
                    text="custom">Ordinary Differential
                    Equations</xref>, introduces differential
                    equations in one variable along with methods for
                    their solution and several applications.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The next part, <xref ref="part-pdes"
                    text="custom">Partial Differential
                    Equations</xref>, introduces Fourier series and
                    differential equations in several variables,
                    building up to solving the heat and wave
                    equations.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        This document is very much <em>in progress</em> and therefore
        typos and other errors are to be expected.  If you find any, I
        would appreciate you letting me know by contacting me by
        email.
